##What is this project

    This is a project for the odin project curriculum. The idea is to make a
    rock paper scissors game with js playable within the js console.

##Pre project thoughts

    This is going to be the most complicated thing I've done with js
    so far so this should be fun. Here I'll lay out my plan:

    -I'll need a function to randomly select a value of rock,
    paper, or scissors for the enemy ai.
    -I'll need to grab the players input so they can select
    rock paper or scissors.
    -Add logic to see which values beat which values.
    -Keep two variables tracking the players score and
    the opponents score.
    -If the player or opponent reaches 3 points, then they win.

    Later on once I have more experience I'll need to add a proper
    gui to the site instead of having the game played solely
    in the console. But one thing at a time.
